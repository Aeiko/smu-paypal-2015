# SMU PayPal Demo NodeJS

To start the node project, clone the project, and switch to the master branch. 
Then, run `npm install` to install all the node dependencies, and `npm start` 
to start the server.

For simplicity reasons, most of the code is placed in the `index.js` file. Do 
note that you should organise your code properly for maintainability purposes 
when you are writing an application for your startup. A recommended framework 
to use for projects that need proper code organisation would be KrakenJS, 
which is built on top of many other powerful open source projects.

If you are interested in understanding the step by step implementation of the 
PayPal billing agreement/subscription endpoints, feel free to go through the 
branches. The branches has been numbered and represents each step of the 
development process.
